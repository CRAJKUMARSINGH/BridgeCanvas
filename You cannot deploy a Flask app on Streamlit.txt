You cannot deploy a Flask app on Streamlit Community Cloud—the service only supports Streamlit apps (, 
).
If you try to push a file that contains app.run(...) (Flask), the container will repeatedly crash and you’ll see the “Runner tired / Nothing happens” symptom you described.
What you can do instead:

    Keep the two frameworks separate
    • Host your Flask API on a different platform (Heroku, Railway, Render, PythonAnywhere, etc.).
    • Build a Streamlit frontend that calls the Flask endpoints with requests.
    • Deploy the Streamlit frontend on Streamlit Cloud and point it to the live Flask URL instead of localhost (

, , 
).
If you only need a web interface, rewrite the app in pure Streamlit and drop Flask entirely.
If you insist on a single codebase, containerise both services with Docker and deploy the whole stack to a VPS (AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, etc.) (

    ).

In short: Streamlit Cloud ≠ Flask host. Pick one of the above patterns and you’ll be up and running.
